This directory contains dumps of the socketed ROM's on the main and core boards.

Some of the ROM's were soldered directly to the PCB without sockets so I
don't have dumps for all of the ROM's.

Once I can get the machine alive, I may be able to dump the rest on-device.

The file `character-set.png` contains a dump of the character bitmaps in the
character generator ROM IC13 on the main board.
